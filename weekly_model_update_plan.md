# Weekly Model Update Plan for College Football Predictions

## 🎯 Overview
This plan outlines how to update your ML prediction model with real game results each week during the 2025 college football season.

## 📅 Weekly Update Schedule
- **Day:** Monday (after all Week 1 games are complete)
- **Time:** Morning (to have updated predictions for the next week)
- **Frequency:** Every week during the season (Weeks 1-12)

## 🔄 Update Process

### Phase 1: Data Collection (Monday Morning)
1. **Scrape Week 1 Game Results**
   - Final scores for all games
   - Team statistics (yards, turnovers, time of possession, etc.)
   - Player performance data (if available)

2. **Data Sources to Use:**
   - ESPN API or web scraping
   - College Football Data (CFBD) API
   - NCAA official statistics
   - Sports Reference (college football)

### Phase 2: Update Team Statistics
1. **Calculate New Team Stats:**
   - Points per game (updated with real results)
   - Yards per game (offense and defense)
   - Turnover margin
   - Third-down conversion rates
   - Red zone efficiency
   - Time of possession
   - Penalties per game

2. **Update Historical Averages:**
   - Rolling averages (last 3 games, last 5 games)
   - Season-to-date averages
   - Conference averages

### Phase 3: Model Retraining
1. **Prepare Training Data:**
   - Add Week 1 results to training dataset
   - Update team feature vectors
   - Recalculate team ratings (SP+, FPI, etc.)

2. **Retrain Models:**
   - Logistic Regression
   - Random Forest
   - Gradient Boosting
   - Select best performing model

3. **Validate Model Performance:**
   - Test on Week 1 predictions vs actual results
   - Calculate accuracy metrics
   - Compare to previous model performance

### Phase 4: Deploy Updated Model
1. **Update Model Files:**
   - Save new trained model
   - Update feature scalers
   - Update team statistics JSON

2. **Deploy to Production:**
   - Update GitHub repository
   - Deploy to GitHub Pages
   - Test live predictions
