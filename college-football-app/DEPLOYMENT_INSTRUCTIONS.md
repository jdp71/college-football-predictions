# ðŸš€ GitHub Pages Deployment Instructions

## The Issue
Your GitHub Pages is configured to deploy from the `main` branch, but our updates are on the `master` branch. That's why you're still seeing the old app.

## Quick Fix - Manual Upload to Main Branch

### Step 1: Go to GitHub Repository
1. Open [https://github.com/jdp71/college-football-predictions](https://github.com/jdp71/college-football-predictions)
2. Make sure you're on the `main` branch (check the branch dropdown)

### Step 2: Replace Files
1. Click "Upload files" button
2. Drag and drop these files from your local `college-football-app` folder:
   - `app.js` (the fixed version)
   - `teams.json` (with current season stats)
   - `index.html` (updated version)
   - `styles.css` (updated styles)
   - `schedule_data.js` (with all teams and bye weeks)
   - `performance_tracker.js`
   - `current_season_stats.json`
   - `manifest.json`
   - `sw.js`
   - `README.md`

### Step 3: Commit Changes
1. Add commit message: "Update app with current 2025 season stats and fixed predictions"
2. Click "Commit changes"

### Step 4: Wait for Deployment
1. GitHub Pages will automatically rebuild and deploy
2. Check your site at [https://jdp71.github.io/college-football-predictions/](https://jdp71.github.io/college-football-predictions/)
3. It may take 1-2 minutes to update

## What's Fixed in This Update
âœ… **Teams Dropdown**: No more "Loading teams..." - shows all 64 teams  
âœ… **Weeks Dropdown**: Shows Week 0 through Week 16  
âœ… **Current Season Stats**: Real 2025 performance data for all teams  
âœ… **Utah vs Wyoming**: Now shows Utah as clear favorite (realistic prediction)  
âœ… **BYU Bye Week**: Correctly shows BYU's Week 3 bye  
âœ… **Enhanced Game Info**: Shows date, time, TV network, and notes  
âœ… **Mobile Ready**: Works perfectly on your phone  

## Alternative: Use the Zip File
If manual upload doesn't work, you can:
1. Use the `college-football-app-deployment.zip` file I created
2. Extract it and upload all files to the `main` branch

## Verify It's Working
After deployment, test these features:
1. **Team dropdown** should show all teams (no loading message)
2. **Week dropdown** should show Week 0-16
3. **Select Utah** and any week to see their games
4. **Utah vs Wyoming** should show Utah as the favorite
5. **Mobile access** should work perfectly

The app will now use real current season stats instead of random numbers!
