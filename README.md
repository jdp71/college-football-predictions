## üõ†Ô∏è How to Deploy to GitHub Pages

### Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and create a new repository
2. Name it something like `ncaa-football-predictions` or `college-football-stats`
3. Make it public (required for GitHub Pages)

### Step 2: Upload Your Files

1. Clone your repository locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. Copy the files from this project:
   - `index.html` (main application)
   - `app.js` (prediction logic)
   - `README.md` (this file)

3. Update the GitHub badge in `index.html`:
   ```html
   <a href="https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name" class="github-badge">
   ```

4. Commit and push your files:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: College Football Predictions"
   git push origin main
   ```

### Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on "Settings" tab
3. Scroll down to "Pages" section
4. Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
5. Choose "main" branch and "/ (root)" folder
6. Click "Save"

Your site will be available at: `https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name`

## üß† How the Prediction System Works

This application uses a sophisticated prediction algorithm that considers:

- **Conference Strength**: Different conferences have different baseline strength levels
- **Team Statistics**: Points per game, yards per game, turnovers, etc.
- **Home Field Advantage**: Teams perform better at home
- **Historical Data**: Conference matchups and rivalry factors
- **Seeded Randomness**: Consistent predictions for the same matchup

### Prediction Features

- **Win Probability**: Percentage chance each team wins
- **Confidence Level**: How certain the model is about the prediction
- **Spread Estimate**: Predicted point spread
- **Conference Analysis**: Specialized predictions for conference games
